# product-card-app

To practice the Vue.js lifecycle hooks examples on your local system, youâ€™ll need to set up a basic Vue.js project. Here are the steps to get you started:

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from Node.js official website.

Step 2: Install Vue CLI
Vue CLI is a command-line tool that helps you set up a Vue.js project quickly. Install it globally using npm:

npm install -g @vue/cli

Step 3: Create a New Vue Project
Create a new Vue project using Vue CLI:

vue create product-card-app

Follow the prompts to set up your project. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your needs.

Step 4: Navigate to Your Project Directory
cd product-card-app

Step 5: Run the Development Server
Start the development server to see your project in action:

npm run serve

This will start a local server, and you can view your project in the browser at http://localhost:8080.
